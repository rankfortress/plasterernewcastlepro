All our team members are dedicated to providing excellent customer service and making your experience stress-free.Plastering is one of the most common jobs that plasterers do. Plasters are responsible for new homes, extensions to existing home and commercial property renovations which often require a smooth finish. In order to produce an excellent plaster job there needs to be two coats applied using either trowels or putty knives with sandpaper as finishing material in between each coat application. Plasterers can do much more than just plastering. They can install drywall, cornice and suspended ceilings as well as installing gyprock onto new or existing homes.
